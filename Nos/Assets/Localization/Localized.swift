// MARK: - Generic

/// Localized is an enumeration of all the strings in our app that can be translated into supported languages.
///
///    Use as follows:
///
///    enum Text: String, Localizable {
///        case hello = "Hello!"
///        case greeting = "Hello {{ name }}!"
///    }
///
///    Text.hello.string
///        Hello!
///
///    Text.greeting.string(["name": "friend"])
///        Hello friend!
///
///    To create a localizable strings file, you can conform your enum to CaseIterable,
///    and then call the following:
///
///    Text.exportForStringsFile()
///        "Text.hello" = "Hello.";
///        "Text.greeting" = "Hello {{ name }}.";
///
///    Then simply implement localization in the `string` function:
///
///        var string: String {
///            return NSLocalizedString(key, comment: "")
///        }
///
